### Project Introduction
Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season since 1952, although the term "Black Friday" did not become widely used until more recent decades. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on Thanksgiving. The major challenge for a Retail store or eCommerce business is to choose product price such that they get maximum profit at the end of the sales. Our project deals with determining the product prices based on the historical retail store sales data. After generating the predictions, our model will help the retail store to decide the price of the products to earn more profits.

### Dataset Description
The dataset is acquired from an online data analytics hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya. The data contained features like age, gender, marital status, categories of products purchased, city demographics, purchase amount etc. The data consists of 12 columns and 537577 records. Our model will be predicting the purchase amount of the products.
